          After what felt like forever I finally had a run of clear nights this
          week so made the most of it.
          <br />
          <br /> I decided to image M81 and M82 again with my 130PDS as it had a
          longer focal length than the 72ED I previously used.
          <br />
          <br /> In total I managed to get about 10hrs of broadband and 3 hours
          of L-Extreme data for the Ha regions. I would have liked to get more
          but the weather has unfortunately gone back to normal (rain and

          This is the Tadpoles Nebula in the constellation Auriga (IC410). I
          started to capture data on this nebula back in December, in between
          other targets and ended up with about 5 hours of data. I added another
          6.5 hours last night and this is the result!
          <br />
          <br />
          This is probably the longest I&apos;ve spent acquiring data on a
          single target so far (2 months), as when the moon is out it sits slap
          bang in the middle of Auriga from my position, so I&apos;ve had to
          wait for clear AND moonless nights to finish this!

          This is this year&apos;s capture of the Orion and Running Man Nebula
          (M42). It&apos;ll probably become an annual thing!

          <br />
          I&apos;m very happy with how the final image turned out. I&apos;m
          actually using less data than my last attempt, but the data itself was
          better and my processing has improved a lot, which has resulted in a
          much better image in my opinion.
          <br />
          <br />I blended broadband and narrowband data at different exposure
          times for the core and star detail, which has made a big difference
          when compared to narrowband only as in my last attempt.

          have a pop at it myself!
          <br />

          It&apos;s called Comet E3 2022 (ZTF), and was only discovered last
          year.

          <br />
          It orbits every 50&apos;000 years making this a literal once in a

          our early ancestors! This is 60x 60s exposures taken on the 23rd Jan.
